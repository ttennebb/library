# library
This repository contains some ruby extensions written in C. The extensions are compiled to shared objects for Linux. I've tried to make the code somewhat self explanatory. With that, the use of the shared objects aren't necessarily well documented and may require a little work on behalf of the user. Although I will try my best to show simple examples of usage.

Hopefully, the code may be of use.
