the shared object rb_sem.so was built on Mint Linux and 1.9.3p484 (2013-11-22 revision 43786) [x86_64-linux]
YMMV

the files client.rb and server.rb show the implementation of the semaphore
library in ruby scripts.

the client.txt and server.txt are the "c" side of the semaphore implementation.
i left these two in text form to distinguish them from the library code.
